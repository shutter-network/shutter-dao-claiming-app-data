# claiming-app-data
The code in this repository was originally copied from the [gnosis/safe-claiming-app-data](https://github.com/safe-global/claiming-app-data/)Â repo and then modified to suit the Shutter DAO requirements.

A vesting data converter and proof generator.


### Prerequisites

- Place csv files with vesting data under `vestings/assets/{chain_id}/*.csv`.

### Vesting CSVs
Vesting CSV files contains the following fields

- `owner`: Must be an Ethereum address
- `amount`: Token amount to be allocated
- `duration`: Vesting duration in months
- `startDate`: Vesting start date (ISO 8601 Format YYYY-MM-DD)
- `initialUnlock`: Initial unlocked token share in decimal fraction (0...1)
- `requiresSPT`: TRUE or FALSE if it is required to exchange SPT tokens upon claiming tokens (only valid for SPT holders)

### Allocation file structure

#### Vesting file 
Contains all defined allocations for a specific address with proofs.
```
[
    {
        "tag": "[user | spt_conversion]",
        "account": "checksummed address",
        "chainId": chain id,
        "vestingId": "vesting hash",
        "durationWeeks": integer,
        "startDate": timestamp,
        "amount": "amount in wei",
        "curve": integer,
        "proof": [
        ]
    },
    ...
 ]
```


# Setting up locally
Create a Python virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
```
Activate a virtual environment
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install -f
```

## Generating output files

The exporter script can parse vesting CSV files, generate proofs, and export data for claiming. The steps mentioned earlier can be performed at once or separately.

Example:
```
cd vestings
python exporter.py --chain-id 1 --output-directory ../data/allocations
```

Exporter will place generated files under `{output_directory}/{chain_id}`

### Output files
For each address, an allocation file is created `{address}.json`. These files contain the Merkle proof and all relevant data to redeem the tokens into the vesting pool contract later.

Additionally, the file `root.txt` containing the Merkle root is created. Take this value and configure the respective parameter upon DAO deployment.

All files are located under `{output_directory}/{chain_id}`.
